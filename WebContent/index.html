<h1>Welcome to Luciano</h1>

<p>Buonasera, benvenuti a Luciano!

<p>We welcome you to a unique dining experience with us at Luciano.  Our
staff is eager to serve you, and we are pleased to offer you a wonderful
range of dining experiences in our <i>&quot;Bellissimo Ristorante&quot;</i>.

<h2>Tradizionale Dining</h2>

<p>Relax in our traditional dining room featuring a Mediterranian atmosphere.
Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner for two or dining with
family and friends, old world charm provides the perfect ambience for
a memorable dining experience.

<h2>Chez Savalle</h2>

<p>It started with a dream.  Dave McConnell was just beginning to hone his
craft as a singer of the American songbook. One night he dreamed that
he was walking down a street. Mansions with wrought iron fences stood to
either side. Ahead, he saw a piano in the yard of a beautiful home.
Seated behind the keyboard, facing Dave, was a distinguised African
American gentleman. A jazz pianist. Dave was entranced by the man as 
he continued walking towards him. Then the pianist turned to him and said, 
&quot;Your place is gonna be Chez Savalle&quot;.

<p>On our <i>&quot;Serate di Musica&quot;</i>, Music Nights, you can find 
Dave or other singers and musicians performing jazz standards and pop 
favorites accompanied by some of Huntsville's most accomplished jazz and 
musical theater pianists.

<p>The quarters are cozy, as one would expect for a European style venue;
classy, yet inviting with a sense of casual elegance.  The fireplace
anchors the room and the traditional oak bar with its brass top is the
perfect place to enjoy fine wine or a favorite cocktail. 

<p>Enjoy the musical atmosphere of Chez Savalle any night,
whether you're stopping in for a drink and appetizers, or enjoying
a four course dinner of Luciano's Italian <i>&quot;Culinario&quot;</i>.
 
<h2>Cortile</h2>

<p>Five steps down from Chez Savalle Piano Bar, you are suddenly
transported into the courtyard of a small Italian village.  Looking
around, you have the sense that quaint apartments overlook the 
tables nesteled in the square.  The high ceiling gives the room an
airy feel, while the open wall back into Chez Savalle allows you
enjoy <i>&quot;Serate di Musica&quot;</i>, Music Nights from our live piano
bar.

<p>Adding to the room's charm, a bit of Huntsville history adorns
the Cortile.  The antique shutters of the windows, and glass door of the
balcony hail from the original Monte Sano Hotel, a three-story Queen 
Anneâ€“style luxury health resort that opened in 1877

<h2>Terrazza</h2>

<p>For those that delight in <i>&quot;Al Fresco&quot;</i> dining, we offer our 
beautiful Terrazza. Leisurely sip a glass of wine while you read a book,
converse with friends, or simply enjoy the soft summer breeze.  Our moderate
southern climate allows for comfortable outdoor dining from March through
October.

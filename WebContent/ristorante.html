			<h2 class="pagetext">Tradizionale Dining</h2>

			<img src="media/tradizionale.png">

			<p class="pagetext">Relax in our traditional dining room
				featuring a Mediterranian atmosphere. Whether you're looking for a
				romantic dinner for two or dining with family and friends, old world
				charm provides the perfect ambience for a memorable dining
				experience.</p>

			<h2 class="pagetext">Chez Savalle</h2>

			<img src="media/chezsavalle1.png">

			<p class="pagetext">It started with a dream. Dave McConnell was
				just beginning to hone his craft as a singer of the American
				songbook. One night he dreamed that he was walking down a street.
				Mansions with wrought iron fences stood to either side. Ahead, he
				saw a piano in the yard of a beautiful home. Seated behind the
				keyboard, facing Dave, was a distinguised African American
				gentleman. A jazz pianist. Dave was entranced by the man as he
				continued walking towards him. Then the pianist turned to him and
				said, &quot;Your place is gonna be Chez Savalle&quot;.</p>

			<img src="media/chezsavalle2.png">

			<p class="pagetext">
				On our <i>&quot;Serate di Musica&quot;</i>, Music Nights, you can
				find Dave or other singers and musicians performing jazz standards
				and pop favorites accompanied by some of Huntsville's most
				accomplished jazz and musical theater pianists.
			</p>

			<p class="pagetext">The quarters are cozy, as one would expect
				for a European style venue; classy, yet inviting with a sense of
				casual elegance. The fireplace anchors the room and the traditional
				oak bar with its brass top is the perfect place to enjoy fine wine
				or a favorite cocktail.</p>

			<p class="pagetext">
				Enjoy the musical atmosphere of Chez Savalle any night, whether
				you're stopping in for a drink and appetizers, or enjoying a four
				course dinner of Luciano's Italian <i>&quot;Culinario&quot;</i>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2 class="pagetext">Cortile</h2>

			<img src="media/cortile1.png">

			<p class="pagetext">
				Four steps down from Chez Savalle Piano Bar, you are suddenly
				transported into the courtyard of a small Italian village. Looking
				around, you have the sense that quaint apartments overlook the
				tables nesteled in the square. The high ceiling gives the room an
				airy feel, while the open wall back into Chez Savalle allows you
				enjoy <i>&quot;Serate di Musica&quot;</i>, Music Nights from our
				live piano bar.
			</p>

			<img src="media/cortile2.png">

			<p class="pagetext">Adding to the room's charm, a bit of
				Huntsville history adorns the Cortile. The antique shutters of the
				windows, and glass door of the balcony hail from the original Monte
				Sano Hotel, a three-story Queen Anneâ€“style luxury health resort that
				opened in 1877</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2 class="pagetext">Terrazza</h2>

			<img src="media/terazza.png">

			<p class="pagetext">
				For those that delight in <i>&quot;Al Fresco&quot;</i> dining, we
				offer our beautiful Terrazza. Leisurely sip a glass of wine while
				you read a book, converse with friends, or simply enjoy the soft
				summer breeze. Our moderate southern climate allows for comfortable
				outdoor dining from March through October.
